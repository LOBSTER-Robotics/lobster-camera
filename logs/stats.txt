These are the stats from trying each resolution once for 100 seconds.
Dropped buffers mean a frame is skipped this is recoverable. Failed buffers mean
the frame size is different from expected and this is only recoverable on
restart.

Lower resolutions result in fewer dropped buffers, but it's very rare to record
100 seconds without dropping at least 1 buffer
